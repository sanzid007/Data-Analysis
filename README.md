# 🏪 Superstore Sales Analysis

This project performs a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the [Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final/) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability. It is an excellent example of turning raw data into actionable business intelligence.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Analyze regional, segment-wise, and category-level sales and profit performance
- Identify top and bottom-performing products
- Study discounting patterns and their effect on profit
- Understand customer purchasing behavior
- Visualize trends over time

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- 📍 **West and East** regions generate the highest sales, but profit margins vary significantly.
- 💰 **Technology** is the most profitable category, while **Furniture** often runs at a loss.
- 📉 **High discounts** correlate negatively with profit — aggressive discounting hurts margins.
- 🧍 **Consumer segment** dominates in volume but not necessarily in profitability.
